# Apple Store Reviews - Statistical Analysis
## Project Details
### 1. Rating Analysis
- **Mean:** Calculate the average rating across all reviews.
- **Mode:** Identify the most frequently occurring rating.
- **Median:** Determine the middle value of ratings when sorted in order.
### 2. Variance and Standard Deviation of Likes
- **Variance:** Calculate the average squared deviation of likes from the mean.
- **Standard Deviation:** Determine the spread of likes in the dataset.
### 3. Spread of Purchase Amount
- **IQR (Interquartile Range):** Measure the spread of the middle 50% of purchase amounts.
- **Range:** Find the difference between the highest and lowest purchase amounts.
### 4. Correlation Between Likes and Rating
- **Correlation Coefficient:** Measure the relationship between the number of likes and ratings.
### 5. Distribution of App Ratings
- **Skewness:** Analyze the distribution of ratings to understand the user satisfaction trend.
### 6. Hypothesis Test for Instagram vs WhatsApp Ratings
- **T-Statistic and P-Value:** Perform hypothesis testing to compare average ratings for Instagram and WhatsApp.
### 7. Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem
- **Sampling Distribution:** Create a histogram of sample means.
- **Central Limit Theorem:** Use the CLT to validate inferences from sample data.
## Key Insights
- **Rating Analysis:** The median represents the central tendency of ratings more accurately than the mean.

- **Likes and Engagement:** There is significant variability in user engagement (likes).

- **Purchase Amount:** The IQR provides insights into typical spending, while the range highlights overall variability.

- **Likes vs Ratings:** Higher-rated reviews tend to receive more likes.

- **Instagram vs WhatsApp:** No significant difference was found between their average ratings.
## Conclusion
This analysis reveals key insights into user engagement, spending behavior, and app ratings. The median is a better measure of central tendency for ratings, and likes show high variability. Purchase amounts have a typical range captured by IQR, while higher-rated reviews tend to receive more likes. No significant difference was found between Instagram and WhatsApp ratings. Lastly, the Central Limit Theorem confirms the reliability of statistical inferences from sample data.
